# Ghana Community Vulnerability Score (Methodology)

## Overview
Average community vulnerability score on a scale of 3 to 15, where higher values represent higher levels of vulnerability, based on communitiesâ€™ 1) exposure risk, 2) comorbidities risk, and 3) other vulnerabilities.

## Components Included

### 1.Exposure

Exposure components include equally weighted indicators of: 

| **Variable**      | **Variable Description**  | **Source** |

### 2.Comorbidities

The comorbidities component includes equally weighted indicators of:
| **Variable**      | **Variable Description**  | **Source** |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| 1 |<code> Elderly population aged 60+</code>      | Elderly population aged 60 and older | Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 2014 |

| 3 |<code> Percentage of adults who have been diagnosed with high blood pressures or hypertension </code>      |   Percentage of adults (15-49) who have ever been told by a doctor or healthcare worker that they had high blood pressure or hypertension | Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 2014 |
| 4 |<code>  Mean HIV prevalence  </code>      |   Adult (15-49) mean HIV prevalence estimated by IHME at the 5 km squared level | Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation |


### 3.Vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities component is based on equally weighted indicators for:

| **Variable**      | **Variable Description**  | **Source** |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| 1 |<code> Information access</code>      | Two indicators are equally weighted within the information access sub-component: 3a.1) percentage of households with no cell phones in the household, and 3a.2) percentage of households with no radio, internet, or television and no adults aged 15 to 49 who regularly consume traditional media (newspaper, radio, television). Regular consumption is defined as reading, listening, or watching the media at least once a week.  | Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 2014 |
| 2 |<code> Vaccination likeliness </code>      |  Rate of female adult (15-49) obesity | Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 2014 |
| 3 |<code> Prevention </code>      |    Two indicators are equally weighted within the prevention sub-component: 1) percentage of individuals with no soap available for handwashing inside the household, and 2) percentage of individuals with no water available for handwashing inside the household. | Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 2014 |



Indicators within components and sub-components are combined with z-scores at the 1 km squared grid level. The total of all z-scores is then classified into a component and sub-component score ranging from 1 to 5 by quintile. Sub-components are added together and classified into a component score ranging from 1 to 5 by quintile. All three components are then added together.
